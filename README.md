# How to behave in a manual (offline) crypto-to-fiat transaction.

> TL;DR
1. Find a safe public place (caf√© or coffeehouse).
1. Pick the least volatile cryptocurrency .
1. Agree on a price. The price is final. It should not be changed untill the end of the transaction.
1. Exchange the addresses. Send your contact your **public key** or **bank account details** or **prepare cash**. 
1. Double check information that was provided in the previous step, especially the **public key**.
1. Perform the transaction.

## Overview
Every now and then you'll enter in a deal where you'll want to buy/sell some crypto for fiat in a direct transaction with a friend or a lesser known contact.
Say, your friend asked you for some Bitcoins (because s/he does not have access to Coinbase, for example) and you are willing to help.
The **problem** is: crypto is very volatile. Prices can change dramaticaly even while the manual transaction is being executed. Prices differ between exchanges. This can cause conflict and misunderstanding between buyer and seller at the time of the transaction.

Picture the following conversation:
- **Person A**: "Let's deal at $500/Bitcoin‚Ä¶ on these two exchanges it goes for $490 on this one for $520‚Ä¶ so let's take the average"
- **Person B**: "Okay. $500/bitcoin. Deal. Here is my public key 49GPtAMvr‚Ä¶"
- **Person A**: "Here are my bank account details‚Ä¶"
(5 minutes later)
- **Person A**: "Ok. Sent $$$ to your bank account"
- **Person B**: "Hold on‚Ä¶ the price just significantly moved! Let's deal at $480 per Bitcoin"
- **Person A**: "WTF?! We agreed on $500 just now‚Ä¶ Not cool‚Ä¶ WTF are you thinking?"

The situation above is definitely not very plaesant. Market price shifted in favor of Person A and Person B wanted a correction‚Ä¶ But the price could have moved the other way as well. You never know. Both of them were taking equal risk.
